        description : "Black holes are where general relativity and quantum mechanics converge at their limits. Any unification model (“theory of everything”) must include these two theories. In binary matrices, which were used by Heisenberg to describe quantum mechanics, the highest probability non-trivial eigenvalues are the golden ratio, and negative one over the golden ratio. The golden ratio appears fundamentally in quantum mechanics and in black holes."
