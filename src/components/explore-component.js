                    <p><b>Fibonacci Series- </b>
                        It is a series in which each term is the sum
                        of the two preceding ones,starting from 0 and 1.
                     </p>
                    <p>The seires begins as - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...</p>
                    <p>The <span className="gold">Golden </span> 
                        ratio and Fibonacci series have a very special relation. 
                        When we take any two successive (one after the other) Fibonacci Numbers, 
                        their ratio is very close to the <span className="gold">Golden</span> Ratio.
                        For eg- 13/8 = 1.625 ~ Î¦ (1.618033988749895...).
